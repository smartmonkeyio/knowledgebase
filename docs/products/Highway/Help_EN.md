# Highway help

## Upload file with list of services and vehicles
Highway is capable of processing Excel files (XLS y XLSX) with a predefined standard format of columns by SmartMonkey.

## Download template to fill your list of services and vehicles
On the Optimizer page there is a link to download the template "Download template". 

## Troubleshooting the file upload 
Highway works with a predefined format by SmartMonkey. If there are problems with the upload follow these steps: 

* **"The page X does not exist in the uploaded document."**
This error message is triggered because the main sheets do not have the defined name. The document must have the Sheets "services" and "vehicles" (both in lowercase) to process the data. 

* **"The column X does not exist in the Y sheet from the uploaded document."** 
This error message is triggered because the needed columns for the services and the vehicles are not available or have different names.  

* **"The format of the column X is not validâ€œ** 
This error message is triggered because the expectated data within the columns does not match the expected format.
