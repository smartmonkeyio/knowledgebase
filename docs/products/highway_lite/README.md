## Initial Setup ##
To start using the Add-on please  install it first. Visit the [G Suite Marketplace](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace) and look for SmartMonkey. Select the Add-on and press the button "LAUNCH". 

A new Spread Sheet opens with Highway Lite installed. 

Open the menu "Add-ons" to confirm that Highway is installed. If succesfully added, the SmartMonkey Add-on should appear on the list. 

**Granting rights for current Sheet**<br/>
If the menu item does have only one subitem "Help", it means that the Add-on has not enough rights to start.  
Press the button "Manage Add-ons" and on the popup press the button "Manage" which will expand a menu. Select "Use in this document".
This is needed for every new Sheet you start. 

Now you should be able to see the following menu. If not, please reload the page.

## Stops ##
Press "Optimize route" on the submenu of Highway Lite. 
![SmartMonkey Highway Lite Add-on menu](./images/add_on_menu_filled.png)

When the Addon initiates it creates two tabs on the bottom: Stops and Fleet. 

The Stops Sheet is filled with sample data. Here you should fill in your stops addresses. 

On the right panel you'll find the button "Geocode" that will generate latitudes and longitudes for all the stops. 

If a Stop can not be located Highway Lite generates a new Sheet titled "Stops not found". See FAQs below for information on how to solve Geolocation issues. 

## Fleet ##
Jumping to the next Sheet "Fleet" you are asked to fill in the location of your route origin and destination. Usually it is the warehouse or office address. 

## Stop time ##
On the next step you can configure the average time needed for the stops. Default value is set to 5 minutes. 

## Results ##
After the optimization a new Sheet "Results" is created. It contains the optimized route based on all previous parameters. 

With the button "Visualize the routes on a map" you can view the route on a Google map.
